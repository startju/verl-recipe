# Recipe: Partial Rollout (PRv3)

English | [简体中文](README_zh.md)

A partial-rollout pipeline for **synchronous RL training**, designed to reclaim GPU bubbles caused by **long-tail response lengths** via sample supplementation and mid-generation interruption with cross-step resume.

> ⚠️ **Don't confuse this with the fully-async framework's partial rollout.** This pipeline still runs the synchronous loop "rollout → wait for batch → one train step"; the only twist is that long-tail samples can be interrupted mid-rollout and resumed in a later step. Trainer and rollout phases remain serial. If you want the trainer/rollout fully decoupled and advancing concurrently, see `verl/experimental/fully_async_policy/` — not here.

> 📎 **Origin.** This implementation is based primarily on Tencent's APR proposal in [verl-recipe#58](https://github.com/verl-project/verl-recipe/pull/58) (Async Partial Rollout, SSIM + Rollout Caching, decoupled IS). PRv3 is a continuation of that work — same three-queue scheduling and partial-rollout semantics, with several follow-up changes detailed in [Continuation of verl-recipe#58](#continuation-of-verl-recipe58) below.

Background and method comparison (APRIL) live in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md). This README only covers **when to use it, the architecture, and how to run it**.

---

## When to use

Use it when:

- The dataset has a **long-tailed response length distribution** (a small fraction of very long samples drags down each step).
- Synchronous PPO/GRPO shows a visible GPU bubble waiting on those long-tail samples.
- Training tolerates **mild off-policy drift** — partial rollout inherently spans multiple weight versions; pair it with IS correction.
- Multi-turn / tool-call workloads where the vLLM server can be interrupted (requires `PRv3vLLMHttpServer`, not the upstream server).

Skip it when:

- Response lengths are uniform with no long-tail bubble — the plain synchronous trainer is simpler.
- Strict on-policy is required (every trajectory must come from the current weights).
- You need to mix this pipeline with the upstream sync trainer's batch-shape assumptions — PRv3-specific fields (dummy `gen_batch`, `last_agent_loop_output`, …) would break them.

## Architecture

Three actors coordinated by one Ray actor scheduler:

| Component | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `PRv3RayPPOTrainer` | `ray_trainer.py` | Main trainer loop. `_fit_generate` pushes prompts into the manager, awaits one full batch via `async_rollout_manager.generate_sequences`, then runs log_prob / advantage / policy update. |
| `RolloutPromptManager` | `prompt_manager.py` | Single-threaded Ray actor holding the three queues (pending / ongoing / done). `pull_batch` is async + `asyncio.Event`-driven, no busy polling. `pull_prompts(traj_count)` budgets by trajectory count (using `get_unfinished_traj_count`), so partial prompts consume only their remaining-aborted-traj budget rather than a full `n`. |
| `PRv3AgentLoopManager` / `PRv3AgentLoopWorker` | `agent_loop/agent_loop.py` | Manager dispatches and drives vLLM cancel/resume; workers pull prompts, run the agent loop, push results back. Workers track per-task consumed traj budget in a `dict[Task, int]` so refill after completions matches the actual freed budget (not `n × len(done)`). |
| `PRv3SingleTurnAgentLoop` / `PRv3ToolAgentLoop` | `agent_loop/{single_turn,tool}_agent_loop.py` | Partial-rollout-aware versions of the upstream agent loops. Inspect `last_agent_loop_output`: pass through if done, resume from the interruption point if aborted. |
| `PRv3vLLMHttpServer` / `PRv3vLLMReplica` | `vllm_rollout/vllm_async_server.py` | Upstream vLLM HTTP server extended with `cancel()` / `resume()` and a `paused` gate. `cancel()` flips `paused=True` and calls vLLM's `abort_all_requests` (engine-level batch abort) until in-flight drains — one engine-core call instead of a per-request cancel storm. Each in-flight `generate()` then returns an ABORT `TokenOutput` naturally. |

## Key invariants

1. **Prompt ownership during scheduling**: at any instant a prompt lives in exactly one of pending / ongoing / done. `pull_prompts` moves pending→ongoing; `push_prompts` decides ongoing→done or ongoing→pending (aborted resume) based on `is_prompt_done`.
2. **`stop_reason == "aborted"` is the resume signal**: anything else (including `missing` / `None`) is treated as done. This is intentional, not a bug — read the comments in `prompt_manager.py` before changing `is_prompt_done`.
3. **Inflight is bounded by trajectory budget, not prompt count**: `pull_prompts(traj_count)` pops prompts until accumulated unfinished-traj reaches `traj_count`. A worker holding partial prompts (with fewer remaining aborted traj per prompt) can hold proportionally more prompts in flight while the total traj load stays the same.
4. **PRv3 agent loops resume via kwargs**: the training path always injects `kwargs["last_agent_loop_output"]`; the validate path doesn't, and PRv3 subclasses fall back to the upstream implementation by checking `kwargs["_prv3_is_validate"]`.
5. **The dummy `gen_batch` must carry `uid`**: when the dataloader is exhausted at the end of an epoch, the placeholder batch built to drain in-flight prompts still needs `non_tensor_batch["uid"]`, otherwise the manager can't compute the row count.
6. **Stateful dataloader resume**: `PRv3RayPPOTrainer.fit()` resumes via the stateful dataloader automatically — **don't** add manual skip-on-resume logic.

## Quick start

### Partial-rollout runs

Single-turn:
```bash
bash recipe/partial_rollout/run_qwen3-0.6b_gsm8k_grpo.sh
```

Multi-turn with tool calls — first generate the tool-agent dataset:
```bash
python3 examples/data_preprocess/gsm8k_multiturn_w_tool.py \
    --local_save_dir $HOME/data/gsm8k_tool
```
then launch:
```bash
bash recipe/partial_rollout/run_qwen3-0.6b_gsm8k_grpo_tool.sh
```

### Baseline runs (vanilla GRPO, for A/B against partial rollout)

Same model / data / batch / hyperparameters; the only differences from the PR variants are the upstream entry, the upstream agent loop, and no IS correction:
```bash
bash recipe/partial_rollout/run_qwen3-0.6b_gsm8k_grpo_baseline.sh
bash recipe/partial_rollout/run_qwen3-0.6b_gsm8k_grpo_tool_baseline.sh
```

### PRv3-specific Hydra overrides

| Key | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.agent.default_agent_loop` | `prv3_single_turn_agent` / `prv3_tool_agent` | Must be a `prv3_`-prefixed agent loop — worker asserts to prevent silent fallback. |
| `algorithm.rollout_correction.rollout_is` | `token` (recommended) / `sequence` | Sequence-level ratios easily hit the `exp(±20)` safety clamp once rollouts span several weight versions. |
| `algorithm.rollout_correction.rollout_is_threshold` | `2.0` | TIS upper bound; for IcePop pass `"0.5_5.0"`. |
| `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.multi_turn.enable` | `True` *(tool variant only)* | Enables multi-turn. |
| `actor_rollout_ref.rollout.multi_turn.tool_config_path` | YAML path | Tool registry; shared across backends. |

## Continuation of verl-recipe#58

PRv3 keeps the SSIM (Sample Supplementation + Interruption) skeleton and the three-queue scheduling from the original APR proposal. The follow-up changes:

| Area | verl-recipe#58 (APR) | PRv3 (this directory) | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **vLLM cancel** | per-request `asyncio.Event` dict + `Lock`; `cancel()` walks the dict and sets each event, every in-flight `generate` then awaits its own cancel handle | Engine-level batch abort: `paused` flag + `inflight` counter + vLLM `abort_all_requests` (calls `pause_generation` on vLLM ≥ 0.12) in a yielding drain loop | Single engine-core call instead of fanning out per-request cancel handles through one Ray async actor; avoids actor-loop contention as the in-flight count grows. |
| **Inflight budget unit** | prompt count (`pull_pending_prompts(num_rollout_prompts)`) | trajectory count (`pull_prompts(traj_count)` + `get_unfinished_traj_count`) | A partially-rolled-out prompt with k aborted traj costs only k traj of budget, not n. Lets workers carry more partial prompts when the batch has many. |
| **Worker refill accounting** | refill by `len(done) × n` | refill by `sum(consumed_traj for done & fully-done)` recorded in `dict[Task, int]` | Matches the new traj-count budget; partial prompts that finish freed only their consumed traj, not n. |
| **Data flow** | manager owns `StatefulDataLoader`; `pull_pending_prompts` lazily pulls from it when pending is empty | trainer owns the dataloader; pushes batches into the manager via `push_batch` | Keeps the manager stateless w.r.t. epoch/iter cursor. Resume goes through the trainer's normal stateful-dataloader path; the manager doesn't replicate dataset/sampler logic. |
| **Staleness handling** | hard drop: `done_queue.append` only if `max(param_version_diff) < 10` | no drop; let off-policy correction handle it (`algorithm.rollout_correction.rollout_is=token`) | Avoids losing rollouts wholesale when the gate threshold hits; relies on token-level IS to bound divergence. |
| **Scheduling priority** | `get_scheduling_priority` sorts by `(unfinished_samples_num, finished_mean_response_length, max_staleness)` | FIFO with one twist — aborted prompts go to the head of `pending_queue` (`appendleft`) so the next pull resumes them while their KV cache may still be live on the rollout server | Cache-locality optimization for resume; we don't need a full scheduler so far. |

If you're tracking #58, the cancel-path rewrite and the traj-budget refactor are the two changes we'd flag as load-bearing — the rest are scope/data-flow choices that can be lifted back to the recipe layer.
